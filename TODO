Multiplying multiple files doesn't work, split out all multi-mulplications
Fix lesion mask exclusion


multispectral
- store in-progress data in sub-folders of stages
- precorrect with mean threshold
- lsq12 register to T1
- only place multispectral comes into play is in classification


New directory structure

tmpdir/
- inputs (isotropized T1)
  - multispectral
    - <filename>
      - resampled to T1 space files

<number>/
- T1 processing files
  - multispectral
    - <filename>
      multispectral processing files

final/
  - resample priors to original input space
    - multispectral
      <filename>
        - file resampled into T1 input space

TODO
- cleanup iterative steps to remove all commented code
- fix up all multispectral stages
- add easy changing of priors
